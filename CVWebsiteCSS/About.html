          <p>Over the past few months, I’ve been learning how to code in the languages: Python and LUA. <br>
            This has made me curious about game development in which I’ll be getting into by using programs such as Unity and Blender.<br>
            I’ve a passionate interest for 2d animation, it has provided me with the ability to have great patience if I’m working on a big project.<br>
            My passion for the subject has triggered an interest for me to further my knowledge on art so I can improve in that field.</p>
